### Description of data
This data was downloaded from dataplanet, one of the world's largest repositories of standardized and structured statistics. It counts the number of men and women in the central United States who have cancer. The data lists the number of people with four types of cancer from 2009 to 2018. These are breast cancer, larynx cancer, liver cancer and myeloma cancer. The data will be analyzed in a model on the web page to know the trend and the most numerous cancers.

### The widgets and panels
- For the first panel show the general information about the data and the information I am going to analysis and discuss in the web.
- For the plot panel, I created three widgets to reconcile and analyze the data. The first one allows you to select different time ranges and thus see how the number of different genders on four different types of cancer changes over time. This can be adjusted by selecting different genders. The bottom widget allows you to select different graphs, one is a line graph that shows the trend and the other only shows the distribution of different points. For the main panel, you can see the changes and trends of the different graphs presented as the data changes. The four different cancer types are displayed by different colors. The horizontal axis is the different time and the vertical axis is the number of people who got cancer. A description of the image is appended at the bottom and the total number of cancer cases in the graph is also indicated.
- For the table panel, the widget on the left shows the time range, adjusted only for the range of data between 2009 and 2018. The main panel on the left shows a table with averages for the four cancers between years, which allows you to see how the data has changed and to know which cancer has the highest number of people with cancer. Similarly, the text below provides analysis and explanation.
